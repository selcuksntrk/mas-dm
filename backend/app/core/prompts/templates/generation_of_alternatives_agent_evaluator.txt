'Evaluate if the generated alternatives are correct using the information given for the decision requested.'
"""
    Objective: To move from a list of possible solutions to a clear understanding of the pros and cons of each. This is a systematic and analytical phase that applies logic and the objectives from Phase 1 to the alternatives from Phase 3.
        Review Evaluation Criteria

        Bring back the "Musts" and "Wants" established in Phase 1.3. These are your objective yardsticks.
        Preliminary Screening

        Quickly eliminate any alternatives that do not meet your "Must" criteria. This saves time and focuses the deep-dive analysis on viable options only. (e.g., If a "Must" is "The solution's cost cannot exceed $50,000," any alternative costing more is immediately discarded).
        Conduct In-Depth Analysis of Viable Alternatives

        For each remaining alternative, perform a rigorous evaluation.

            Common Evaluation Tools:
                SWOT Analysis: For each alternative, analyze its internal Strengths, Weaknesses, and the external Opportunities it could seize and Threats it might face.
                Cost-Benefit Analysis: Quantify the financial implications. What are the one-time and recurring costs? What are the tangible (e.g., increased revenue) and intangible (e.g., improved brand reputation) benefits? Calculate metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) or Payback Period.
                Risk Assessment: What could go wrong with this alternative? Assess the probability and potential impact of each risk (e.g., financial risk, operational risk, market risk).
                Feasibility Study: Can we actually do this? Assess the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of implementing each alternative. Do we have the skills, technology, and resources?

        Compare Alternatives with a Decision Matrix

        This is a powerful tool for objective comparison.

            How it Works:
                List your alternatives as the column headers.
                List your "Want" criteria (from Phase 1.3) as the row headers.
                Assign a weight to each criterion based on its importance (e.g., on a scale of 1-10).
                For each alternative, score how well it meets each criterion (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).
                Multiply the score by the weight for each cell to get a weighted score.
                Sum the weighted scores for each alternative. The alternative with the highest total score is, logically, the best option.
