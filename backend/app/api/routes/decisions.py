    =================
    This endpoint removes old completed/failed processes to:
    - Free up memory (in-memory repository)
    - Free up Redis memory (Redis repository)
    - Improve query performance
    
    PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATION:
    ==========================
    Don't rely on manual cleanup. Instead:
    1. Add periodic cleanup job (APScheduler, Celery Beat)
    2. Run cleanup daily or hourly based on process volume
    3. Monitor cleanup metrics
    
    Example periodic cleanup:
        from apscheduler.schedulers.asyncio import AsyncIOScheduler
        
        scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler()
        
        async def cleanup_job():

    List all tracked processes with their status.
    
    OBSERVABILITY:
    ==============
    This endpoint is crucial for:
    - Monitoring system health
    - Debugging issues
    - Understanding system load
    
    SCALING CONSIDERATIONS:
    =======================
    With many processes, this could be slow/expensive:
    - Redis: KEYS command scans all keys
    - In-memory: Iterates all processes
    
    Solutions:
    1. Add pagination (offset/limit)
    2. Add filtering (status, date range)
    3. Cache results with short TTL
    4. Use separate counters for stats
    
    Example paginated version:
        @router.get("/processes")
        async def list_processes(
            skip: int = 0,
